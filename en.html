                        <p style="margin:0px">Shalom! <br><br>At Besorat Yeshua (The Good News of Yeshua) we are developing a Harmony of the Gospels with the goal of creating a full picture of Yeshua's life and message.</p>
                        <p>To achieve this, we are carefully comparing the accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, bringing together all the details they contain, and writing a single narrative that includes them all.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The RVR60 version of the Spanish Bible has been used. The English text is the result of translating the harmony from Spanish to English.</li>
                            <li>No words have been added or removed from the Gospels; the details have simply been compiled and organized.</li>
                            <li>In the Spanish version of the site, you can consult the tables used to compare the Gospels. Some tables are yet to be uploaded.</li>
                            <li>The text highlighted in yellow in the tables has been used in the harmony, while other formatting codes indicate common details when they are not in the same rows.</li>
                            <li>When two or more Gospels report an event using different words, and it is relevant to highlight it, we have included all those variations by underlining them.</li>
                            <li>Although several revisions have been made, the possibility of errors exists and readers are invited to question the text and suggest corrections.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <p>We began harmonizing from the end, so currently you can read from Yeshua's arrival at Bethany to the end of the Gospels. The rest of the accounts are pending to be harmonized and/or translated.</p>
