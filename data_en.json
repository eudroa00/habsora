And while He was at the house of Simon the leper, and sitting at the table, they made a dinner for Him there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at the table with Him. <br><br>Then Mary came to Him with a pound of pure nard perfume in an alabaster jar, very costly, and breaking the alabaster jar, she poured it on His head and anointed Yeshua's feet, and wiped them with her hair, while He was sitting at the table. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. Upon seeing this, some of the disciples became indignant within themselves and said: <br><br><div class=\"a-q\">Why has this perfume been wasted?</div> <br>And Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who would later betray Him, said:<br><br><div class=\"a-q\">Why was this perfume not sold for a high price, more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?</div> <br>But he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief and, as he had charge of the moneybag, he used to steal what was put into it. <br><br>And they murmured against her. And Yeshua, understanding this, said to them: <br><br><div class=\"y-q\">Leave her alone. Why do you trouble this woman? She has done a good thing for me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do them good, but you will not always have me. She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for burial. Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.</div>"

And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent a servant to the tenants, that they might give him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the tenants took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.

I will send my beloved son; perhaps when they see him, they will respect him. But when the tenants saw the son, they said one to another, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize his inheritance, that the inheritance may be ours. And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.<br><br>When the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those men? </div><br>They told him: <br><br><div class=\"a-q\">He will come and destroy without mercy these wicked tenants and will lease his vineyard to other tenants, who will pay him the fruit in due season. </div><br>When they heard this, they said to him: <br><br><div class=\"a-q\">Elohim forbid!</div><br> But Yeshua, looking at them, said: <br><br><div class=\"y-q\">Did you never read in the scriptures: <br><br><div class=\"b-q\">The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes. </div><div class=\"h-q\">אֶבֶן מָאֲסוּ הַבֹּונִים הָיְתָה לְרֹאשׁ פִּנָּה<br> מֵאֵת יְהוָה הָיְתָה זֹּאת הִיא נִפְלָאת בְּעֵינֵינוּ</div><br>Therefore, I say unto you, that the kingdom of Elohim shall be taken away from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.
