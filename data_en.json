And while He was at the house of Simon the leper, and sitting at the table, they made a dinner for Him there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was one of those who were sitting at the table with Him. <br><br>Then Mary came to Him with a pound of pure nard perfume in an alabaster jar, very costly, and breaking the alabaster jar, she poured it on His head and anointed Yeshua's feet, and wiped them with her hair, while He was sitting at the table. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. Upon seeing this, some of the disciples became indignant within themselves and said: <br><br><div class=\"a-q\">Why has this perfume been wasted?</div> <br>And Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who would later betray Him, said:<br><br><div class=\"a-q\">Why was this perfume not sold for a high price, more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?</div> <br>But he said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief and, as he had charge of the moneybag, he used to steal what was put into it. <br><br>And they murmured against her. And Yeshua, understanding this, said to them: <br><br><div class=\"y-q\">Leave her alone. Why do you trouble this woman? She has done a good thing for me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do them good, but you will not always have me. She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for burial.
